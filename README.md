## ðŸ”„ Data Flow Summary

```text
1. User triggers an SOS request from the app.
2. Frontend sends the request to the backend API.
3. Backend forwards it to the Dispatch Engine.
4. Dispatch Engine:
   - Queries nearby ambulances
   - Uses AI model to evaluate fastest route
   - Selects optimal ambulance
5. Ambulance is dispatched and notified.
6. Hospital is alerted with patient and ETA data.
7. Real-time tracking updates are pushed via WebSocket to all parties.
